Finalising design

2018-09-01: Cloned from test mega-5

Compiler Errors
---------------
Had a couple of nasty compiler errors.  First one stopped me from putting some declarations inside a switch case.  The 2nd seemed to be a problem using ++value.  After a while the arduino would crash.  Never worked out what's happening with that.

Todo List
---------
* create event driven interface over serial and AT modem objects
* handle error, timeout, re-establish lost wifi link
